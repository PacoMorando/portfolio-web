                    Francisco Morando
    
                    Android and web developer based in México.
    
                    Here is my personal resume
    
                    Tecnologies i kown:
                    SpringBoot, Angular, AndroidStudio, Java, TypeScript, MySQL, SQLite, Git/Github, HTML, XML.
    
                    Certifications
    
                    Self-taught, with 3 years of experience in learning and
                    developing both frontend and backend for mobile and web
                    applications, I have found a new passion in programming.
    
                    I was trained as a Civil Architect at UDG, a profession in
                    which I've been working for 14 years with large teams and
                    leading some small teams in various areas of the
                    profession.
    
                    I am currently highly motivated to become an Architect once
                    again, but this time in the realm of software, with a
                    strong interest in software design and development.
    
    
                    Although I still have a long way to go, I am excited to
                    continue this journey in the professional field.
    
                    Here's a glimpse of some of my personal projects:
    
    
                    Multiplatform Game
                    Java, TypeScript, MySQL,
                    SQLite, AndroidStudio,
                    Angular, SpringBoot.
    
                    Exercise, a result of my learning in architecture and software
                    design. This project is based on a modular design, where the
                    application core/business logic is an independent module that
                    exposes the corresponding interfaces so it can be implemented by
                    different technologies for viewing and persistence.
    
    
                    Graphic Ruler
                    Java, AndroidStudio.
    
                    An application that uses the system information of the device to
                    draw a ruler with 'physical' accuracy.
                    I created this app imagining a tool that could be useful and
                    practical for me as an architect, so it could also be worthwhile
                    for other architects and designers.
    
    
                    Listagram
                    Java, SQLite
                    AndroidStudio.
    
                    This was my first experience programming a complete and functional
                    application.
                    The decision to make a mobile app was because I wanted other
                    people to be able to download and use it easily so I could receive
                    feedback.
    
    
                    This site
                    Angular, TypeScript,
                    Bootstrap.
    
                    I made this website as a part of my learning in web development, and
                    as an exercise to implement a responsive design.
